The Shepherd Sugar Bush will hold its annual open house as a part of the Michigan Maple Syrup Association’s Michigan Maple Weekend. The dates when the Shepherd Sugar Bush will be open is March 17-18 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

During the open house, and depending on the weather, visitors will learn all facets of maple syrup production: collection of sap from the maple trees on the village streets, the reverse osmosis process of removing some water from the sap before evaporation, the evaporation process of sap being changed into pure maple syrup, filtering, canning, candy making, picture display of the vacuum tubing system at the Morbark woods in Winn, tours of the Sugar Bush building.

There will also be free samples of maple syrup, maple candy, maple snacks, and maple-flavored ice cream, as well as activities for children. Maple syrup products will also be available for purchase at this time.

<i>For more information, contact Arnie Hammel at 989-828-5415 or Ron Rhynard at 989-621-6031</i>
