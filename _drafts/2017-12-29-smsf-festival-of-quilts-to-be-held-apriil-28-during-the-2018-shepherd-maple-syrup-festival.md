The Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival of Quilts will be held as a part of the 2018 Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival on Saturday, April 28, 2018 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. inside the Middle School gymnasium.

The Festival of Quilts is a one day exhibition of quilts, throws, table runners and wall hangings shared by community members for the enjoyment of Festival visitors. Quilt-oriented demonstrations will also be included. The Challenge continues again this year. Small pieces of flowered fabric were given to interested participants during last year’s festival. The theme of this year’s Challenge is “Summer Fun.” Participants were challenged to return in 2018 with wall hangings of perimeter 60-100 inches that include a small piece or all of their fabric pieces. This Challenge Competition will be judged.

Community members are welcomed to share their quilting projects (do not have to be made by the owner) as a part of the quilt display. The entries may be new or antique, king sized or mini, wall hangings, or table runners. The Festival is seeking quilts that have not been shown in the past so that room can be made for a variety of different displays.

The deadline for registration will be April 18, 2018. A registration form will be made available online and around the community starting after February 1, 2018.

Anybody who is interested in helping during the Festival of Quilts is encouraged to reach out to a committee member. Responsibilities during the event will include mingling with visitors, handing out voting tickets, and ensuring that the quilts are safely displayed. Four two hour long shifts will be available throughout the event.
