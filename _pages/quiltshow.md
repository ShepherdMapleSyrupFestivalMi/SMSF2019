[tabby title="Information"]

The Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival of Quilts will be held as a part of the 2018 Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival on Saturday, April 28, 2018 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. inside the Middle School gymnasium.

The Festival of Quilts is a one day exhibition of quilts, throws, table runners and wall hangings shared by community members for the enjoyment of Festival visitors. Quilt-oriented demonstrations will also be included. The Challenge continues again this year. Small pieces of flowered fabric were given to interested participants during last year’s festival. The theme of this year’s Challenge is “Summer Fun.” Participants were challenged to return in 2018 with wall hangings of perimeter 60-100 inches that include a small piece or all of their fabric pieces. This Challenge Competition will be judged.
